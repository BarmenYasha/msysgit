Subject: [PATCH] quote paths for non msys programs that contain wildcards

Native windows programs expect to receive quotes in their arguments.
Unlike in the Unix world where they are stripped by the shell.

We are dealing with a thin mingw layer here that makes windows
commandline parsing behave like on Unix seen from inside of the program.
A native Windows program is expected to do wildcard expansion on its
own. Thus mingw automatically adds a layer that does this to every
program compiled (e.g. git).

Problems occur when starting git with a wildcard from bash:

  git log -- "*"

Bash then strips the "" and passes * to the lower layer like its done on
Unix. This is then given to the execution of the program, but because of
the wildcard expansion layer it would currently expand * before its
given to argv[]. Thats why we need to readd "" to all arguments
containing windows wildcards before calling a native program for all
arguments containing Windows wildcards.
